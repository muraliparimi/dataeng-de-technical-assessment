    "# Data Engineer - Technical Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the interview at Beyond Finance, you will be assessed on your ability to perform several Data Engineering tasks. To perform well on this task, you will demonstate competence in the following areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* preprocessing data to prepare for a database load\n",
    "* understanding entity relationships in a database\n",
    "* merging data from different tables\n",
    "* filtering data to relevant subsets\n",
    "* calculating aggregations and descriptive statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be pretty difficult to complete all questions in the allotted time. Your goal is not to speed through the answers, but to come up with answers that demonstrate your knowledge. It's more about your thought process and logic than getting the right answer or your code.\n"

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will be broken into 2 parts\n",
    "1. Data Processing\n",
    "2. Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing\n",
    "In this section you will take files from the ./raw_data/ subfolders, combine them into a single newline-delimited `json.gz` file per subfolder, and place that CSV file in a ./processed_data/ directory. You may have to do some light investigation into the data files to understand their file formats and delimiters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Files\n",
    "- ./raw_data/tracks/tracks_0.csv\n",
    "- ./raw_data/tracks/tracks_1.json\n",
    "- ./raw_data/tracks/tracks_2.csv\n",
    "- etc... \n",
    "\n",
    "should be combined into a single file ./processed_data/tracks.json.gz\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we look for**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can you handle all subfolders in a single pass over the raw data files? \n",
    "  - [Murali Parimi] My process handles all subfolders in one single pass one by one\n",
    "- What if the file sizes are in GigaBytes? Can your code (if run on a standard laptop) load the files without going out of memory? (hint `chunksize`)\n",
    "  - [Murali Parimi] I am using generators and it loads one row at a time to memory. I have provided a pandas version as well in this assignment in a separate cell\n",
    "     - The pure python generator version may fail if the json files come in as an array of json objects\n",
    "- Can you identify edge cases? What scenarios could break your code?\n",
    "  - [Murali Parimi]\n",
    "    - deduplication logic not in place, may bloat volume\n",
    "    - quality checks to ensure dollar amounts makes sense, names are really names, dates are dates etc. -- this will not break code though\n",
    "    - if a different format files or compressed files are landed, we may see failures or at least being logged\n",
    "    - if we have a very very large lines that couldnt fit in the memory even though we are reading one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please directly respond to the above questions in your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling\n",
    "For this section, we'll pretend you loaded the raw data plus additional tables into a small SQLite database containing roughly a dozen tables. **We've provided this database for you so don't worry about loading it yourself**. If you are not familiar with the SQLite database, it uses a fairly complete and standard SQL syntax, though does not many advanced analytics functions. Consider it just a remote datastore for storing and retrieving data from. \n",
